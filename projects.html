        <h1>The Feed Warehouse Management System</h1>
        <p>The Feed is a leading e-commerce platform for athletic nutrution, supplements, and gear.</p>
        <p>I joined the Warehouse Management System developer team to improve order fullfillment efficiency and accuracy.</p>

          <h2>Project #1: Missing Items and Multiple Totes</h2>

          <p><strong>Background:</strong> The Feed integrated a state-of-the-art robotic picking system to fulfill orders.
            
            Robots pick items into totes and deliver them to a human to pack the order.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Goals:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Support high-volume orders that need to be picked into multiple totes</li>
            <li>Allow a Packer to indicate when an order is missing items</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Demo:</strong>
          <p>
            In this video you can see the interface for a Packer gathering multiple totes that are part of the same order. You
            will then see the Packer indicate that items are missing for the order. Finally, the Packer stores the order while the missing items are picked.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In addition to the UI, I implemented a large refactor in the backend to support an order's association to multiple totes.
            
            I also implemented the API requests to the robotic picking system to pick the missing items.

          <h2>Project #2: Floor Pick Batches</h2>
        
          <p><strong>Background:</strong> The Feed wanted their human workers to be able to hand pick orders to supplement
            their robot pickers when order volume was particularly high or the robot system needed maintenance.
          </p>
        
          <p><strong>Goals:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Direct Pickers to a storage location to hand pick items</li>
            <li>Require Pickers to scan the item(s) once to confirm the item is correct</li>
            <li>Batch orders so that a Picker can complete multiple orders simultaneously</li>
            <li>Create an index of batches sorted by number of orders</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p><strong>Demo:</strong>
          <p>
            In this video you can see the index of all batches of orders grouped by common products. You will then see
            the Picker start a batch, scan the item once to confirm it is correct, and retrieve multiples of the product to
            complete 7 orders at once.

        <h1>Automated Attendance Tracking at The Turing School</h1>
        <p>
          The Turing School is online coding bootcamp hosting their student activities over Zoom and Slack.
          The Turing School needed an automated tracking system to standardize attendance across their classrooms and generate reports.

          <h2>Project #1: Slack Attendance</h2>

          <p><strong>Background:</strong> When students are not in class they indicate they are present for their school activities
            by responding to a Slack message.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Goals:</strong>
          <ul>

          </ul>

          <p><strong>Demo:</strong>
          <p>
            In this video you can see how an instructor can take attendance by copy and pasting a Slack message link.
            The application will make a call to the Slack API to determine whether a student was present, tardy, or absent.

          <h2>Project #2: Zoom Attendance</h2>
        
          <p><strong>Background:</strong> Turing students participate in classes via Zoom. The Zoom API does not
          provide unique identifiers for meeting participants outside of the organization, so the application uses the participant 
          name to identify a student. This presents a unique challenge for the application since students can change their names in
          Zoom meetings.

          <p><strong>Goals:</strong>
          <ul>

            <li>Allow instructors to associate multiple participant names in Zoom with a student record</li>

          <p><strong>Demo:</strong>
          <p>
            In this video you can see an instructor resolving an issue where a student changed their Zoom name to
            include their pronouns.

          <h2>Project #3: Populi Transfer</h2>
        
          <p><strong>Background:</strong> Instructors are also required to record attendance data in a separate Student Information System called Populi.
            This process can be very tedious when done by hand.
          
          </p>
        
          <p><strong>Goals:</strong>
          <ul>

          <p><strong>Demo:</strong>
          <p>
            In this video you will see the Populi transfer process. The instructor manually creates the default attendance records in Populi 
            and then completes the automated transfer.

          <h2>Project #4: Reporting</h2>
        
          <p><strong>Background:</strong> Turing needs to generate attendance reports for students across date ranges
          for the Department of Education and their accrediting body.
          </p>
        
          <p><strong>Goals:</strong>

          <p>
            In this final video you can see the app's functionality for generating student attendance reports.
